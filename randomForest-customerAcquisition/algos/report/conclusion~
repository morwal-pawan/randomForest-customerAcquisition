Conclusion and Future Work

In this project we studied about Customer Churn Prediction using tree based machine learning methods.We started with understanding the terminology of the dataset and extracting new features from it.we studied and implemented tree based machine learning algorithms like decision tree, bagging trees and random forests. We this process we learned about the challenges in customer churn analysis and its importance. We thus got a basic understanding of tree based machine learning algorithms ands and its internals. As a future extension to this work, more machine learning algorithms need to be applied on the dataset. Algorithms like gradient boosting, neural networks and stacking can be applied to get better results.More features can also be extracted from the given dataset like seasonal products, popular products etc. All these might further improve the AUC achieved.
