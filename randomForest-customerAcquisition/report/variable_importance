Variable importance:

Bagging Trees and random forest typically results in improved accuracy over the prediction using a single tree.However, it becomes difficult to interpret resulting ensembled trees.
But one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor, called variable importance.A naive variable importance measure to use in tree-based ensemble methods would be to
merely count the number of times each variable is selected by all individual trees in the
ensemble.More elaborate variable importance measures incorporate a (weighted) mean of the individual trees’ improvement in the splitting criterion produced by each variable.A more advanced variable importance measure available in random forests is the “permutation accuracy importance” measure.
Here in this study we use a formula based simplistic approach which is easy to incorporate in the algorithm but is tree based algorithm specific. We use the formula:

log(subscript(10)e^(c/h^k))

Here c and k are constants which can be set according to different requirements like height and range of score needed.
